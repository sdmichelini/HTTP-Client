Webclient

Author: Stephen Michelini

Usage: ./weblclient (URL) (options)

Options are -f for file, next param must be filename, mutually exclusive with -nf, prints HTTP response to filename
-nf print to console, prints HTTP response to console
-pkt collect packet stats, time collected and bytes read
-ping calculates ping time and prints it to console
-info Looks at tcp_info structure for RTT and RTT variance and prints it to console

Not implemented:
Can't change port of webserver from port 80 from the params. Must be hardcoded to switch port

Features:
HTTPS block- URLs requested to https are blocked as SSL is not implemented in this program, also the port 443 is blocked
tcp_socket - seperate base class for a tcp socket which webclient is abstracted upon. 

Sample output:
Command:
./webclient facebook.com -pkt -ping
Output to Console:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://facebook.com/
